	<h3>Use Case</h3>
	<p1>On a warm summer day Peggy is working in her garden. She has immense excitement about growing her own organic vegetables.
	She looks up and realizes that she does not have the vegetables that she wants for her garden. She remembered one of her friends
	telling her about this great website that she can use to buy organic vegetable seeds. She takes off her gardening gloves, goes in
	her home and gets on her Dell desktop computer that runs Windows 10, clicks on Internet Explorer and types in Gardeners.com and presses "Enter.".</p1>
		<p2>Peggy then begins the interaction flow. After all the steps listed below are complete she goes outside
	and begins to plant other seeds that she has on hand. Peggy goes on this site once a month now to order different seeds and equipment. </p2>
